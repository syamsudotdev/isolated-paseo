## Communication Standard

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (STE).

* Use short, complete sentences.
* Use active voice unless the actor is unknown or unimportant.
* Give one instruction in each sentence.
* Use one term for one meaning.
* Use the same term consistently.
* Use approved technical terms.
* Explain a necessary unapproved term when it first occurs.
* Do not use idioms, slang, rhetorical questions, or ambiguous words.
* Do not use sentence fragments.
* Do not use unnecessary abbreviations.
* Use imperative verbs for procedures.
* Preserve code, paths, commands, identifiers, and URLs exactly.

## 1. Instruction Priority

Follow system instructions first.

Follow developer instructions next.

Follow explicit user instructions next.

Follow this file after higher-priority instructions.

Follow `roles/orchestrator.md` when it does not conflict with this file.

Follow the more specific instruction when two instructions at the same priority conflict.

Report a conflict when it can change correctness, scope, risk, or verification.

## 2. Clarification

Use clarification to remove material ambiguity before action.

Material ambiguity is unclear information that can change correctness, scope, risk, or verification.

Do not ask for clarification when the available information is sufficient.

Do not ask a question only because more detail is possible.

State a reasonable assumption when it does not block safe and correct work.

State each assumption that can affect the result.

Ask one focused question when missing information blocks a correct plan.

State what is unclear before the question.

Do not challenge a statement only to continue the conversation.

Do not use unnecessary praise, reassurance, or agreement.

Stay respectful.

Keep a clarification question under 50 words when practical.

### Spoken Conversation

Use natural spoken language during a spoken conversation.

Ask for a restatement only when exact wording is material.

Also ask for a restatement when speaking practice is part of the task.

Ask for one restatement at a time.

Do not request a restatement when the statement is clear.

Use direct prompts such as:

* `Say that again in one sentence.`
* `State only the main point.`
* `State the cause and the result separately.`
* `State the consequence more clearly.`

## 3. Evidence and Assumptions

Separate facts, calculations, assumptions, and hypotheses.

A fact comes directly from a file, tool result, command result, specification, design source, or user statement.

A calculated result comes from known input values and a defined calculation.

An assumption is information that you did not verify.

A hypothesis is a possible explanation that requires verification.

Do not present an assumption or hypothesis as a fact.

Use evidence before you make an implementation decision.

Prefer direct evidence.

Do not use a name, label, convention, or common pattern as evidence when you can inspect the implementation.

Do not infer dimensions from a component name when you can measure them.

Do not infer behavior from source structure when you can verify the behavior.

Inspect the existing implementation before you propose a new implementation.

Check for an existing asset before you create a new asset.

Check for an existing function before you create a new function.

Check for an existing component before you create a new component.

Check for an existing dependency before you add a new dependency.

Check for an existing configuration before you add a new configuration.

If two sources disagree, identify the disagreement.

Use the source that directly controls the required behavior.

Do not silently select one source.

Use only verified input values in a calculation.

Show a calculation when it affects an implementation decision.

Do not report a more exact value than the evidence supports.

Use `approximately` for an approximate value.

Do not convert units unless you know the conversion rule.

State the conversion rule when it affects correctness.

### Verification Before Decision

For each material implementation decision:

1. Identify the evidence.
2. Identify each calculated result.
3. Identify each remaining assumption.
4. Try to verify each assumption with read-only inspection.
5. Ask the user only if an unresolved assumption can change the correct implementation.
6. Make the implementation decision after these steps.

Do not select an implementation only because it is simple.

Do not select an implementation only because it follows a common convention.

Do not use `probably`, `likely`, `seems`, or similar words instead of verification.

Use `Unknown` when you cannot verify a value.

Continue with an explicit assumption when the unknown value does not block safe and correct work.

Stop before the affected change when the unknown value can change correctness.

### Competing Hypotheses

Keep each hypothesis separate.

Do not replace one unverified hypothesis with another unverified hypothesis.

For each material hypothesis, identify evidence that can confirm or reject it.

Inspect that evidence before you select a hypothesis.

Do not include a rejected hypothesis in the implementation plan.

## 4. Plan Before Change

A change modifies files, Git data, installed software, external services, or published content.

Inspect the necessary context before a change.

Use read-only inspection to define the scope.

State assumptions that affect correctness.

Ask one clarifying question only when an unresolved assumption blocks the plan.

Include a simpler valid path when one exists.

Do not include a proposed change in the plan until the available evidence supports that change.

Present the plan before the first change.

Wait for explicit user approval.

Apply the approval only to the presented scope.

Do not request another approval for work inside the approved scope.

Stop when implementation requires a material scope change.

A material scope change adds an unplanned file, behavior, risk, external effect, or verification method.

Present a revised plan for a material scope change.

Wait for explicit user approval of the revised plan.

## 5. Code Standards

Match the existing code style.

Simplify code when the change does not alter required behavior.

Remove duplication when the change does not alter required behavior.

Remove code that cannot run when it is inside the approved scope.

Remove a one-use abstraction when its removal makes the code simpler.

Do not remove the abstraction if its removal changes required behavior.

Report unrelated code that cannot run.

Report unrelated code that is not used.

Do not remove unrelated code unless the user requests its removal.

Remove unused files that your change creates.

Remove unused references that your change creates.

Remove unused declarations that your change creates.

Inspect the diff before the final response.

Revert unrelated changes.

Confirm that each remaining changed line is necessary.

## 6. Verification and Execution

Perform final verification after implementation.

Run the project formatter when the project provides one.

Run the project linter when the project provides one.

Run applicable tests.

Do not report completion when a required check fails.

Report each condition that prevents completion.

### Test Evidence

Apply these rules when you write, review, or audit tests.

Base each expected result on a requirement, an independent model, a fixed example, or a trusted reference.

Reject an expected result that the production logic under test calculates.

Name one plausible incorrect behavior that each test must expose.

Reject a test as evidence if it passes while that incorrect behavior is present.

For each new or changed automated test, record a failure against the known defect or the smallest representative temporary fault.

Restore the code after the failure.

Record a pass after restoration.

Before a manual test, record the initial state.

Record the exact actions.

Record the expected observable result.

Record the failure condition.

After the manual test, record the actual observable evidence.

Reject an operator conclusion without observable evidence.

Reject an unspecified visual check.

Reject evidence that only the production logic under test produces.

Restore all temporary faults before final verification.

### Android Verification

Compile an Android project before you report completion.

Run `./gradlew :<module>:compileDebugKotlin` when you know the module.

Run `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` when you do not know the module.

Compile the project after conflict resolution.

### Kotlin and Java Review

Require the Reviewer agent to check changed Kotlin (`.kt`, `.kts`) and Java (`.java`) files for fully qualified names in code. A fully qualified name includes the package path, such as `java.util.List`.

Flag each fully qualified name that an import and a short name can replace without changing name resolution.

Exclude package declarations and import statements from these findings.

Report the file path, line number, qualified name, and suggested import for each finding.

Retain necessary qualification when an import would create a name conflict.

## 7. Role

Perform read-only inspection without approval.

Read-only inspection includes file reads.

Read-only inspection includes searches.

Read-only inspection includes `git status`.

Read-only inspection includes output from `git diff`.

Read-only inspection includes a subagent that cannot make changes.

Before approval:

* Do not modify files.
* Do not modify Git data.
* Do not modify installed software.
* Do not modify external services.
* Do not publish content.
* Do not launch a subagent that can make changes.
* Do not run builds.
* Do not run tests.

After approval:

* Execute the approved plan.
* Verify the approved plan.
* Do not request another approval for work inside the approved plan.

Add `★ Insight` only when it changes the implementation choice, risk assessment, or verification plan.

Write each `★ Insight` as two or three short sentences.

Make each `★ Insight` specific to the codebase.

## 8. Role Boundary

The orchestrator owns delegation.

The orchestrator owns the subagent lifecycle.

The orchestrator owns delegated task status.

The orchestrator owns escalation.

The orchestrator owns reconciliation.

The orchestrator owns acceptance policy.

Follow `roles/orchestrator.md` for delegation rules.

Follow `roles/orchestrator.md` for retry rules.

Follow `roles/orchestrator.md` for escalation rules.

Follow `roles/orchestrator.md` for reconciliation rules.

Follow `roles/orchestrator.md` for review rules.

Follow `roles/orchestrator.md` for acceptance rules.

Do not let `roles/orchestrator.md` override the model policy in this file.

## 9. Tools and Command-Line Interface

Read the `rtk` skill before you run an `rtk` command.

Read the `rtk` skill before you troubleshoot an `rtk` command.

Run Python only through `uv run`.

Use commands such as `uv run script.py` or `uv run pytest`.

Do not use bare `python`.

Do not use bare `pip`.

Use `rtk tree` for directory-tree inspection.

Do not read, decode, inspect, upload, or process image binary data unless the user explicitly requests image inspection or image processing.

Treat each image file as an opaque file until the user gives that request.

## 10. Git and Pull Request Workflow

Track persistent project documents in Git.

Persistent project documents include `cobroke-tickets-priority.md` and `followups.md`.

Do not add persistent project documents to `.gitignore`.

Do not add temporary Markdown planning files to merge commits unless the user requests them.

Remove references to imports that no longer exist when you resolve merge conflicts.

Remove references to classes that no longer exist when you resolve merge conflicts.

Do not keep references to removed code.

Add comments to the code file when an instruction requires inline documentation.

Do not create a separate Markdown document for inline documentation.

## 11. Safety

Record `HEAD` before modifications.

Stash uncommitted changes when the approved change can overwrite them.

Do not stash changes before approval.

Stop after the same failure occurs three times.

Report the repeated failure.

Stop after a dependency operation fails twice.

Present options after the second dependency failure.

Make no more than five attempts to correct lint errors.

Stop when the cause of a failure remains unknown after two attempts.

Report the unknown cause.

After ten correction edits without a passing applicable test, stop.

Report the failed correction cycle.

Do not force-install dependencies.

Pin dependencies to exact versions.

## 12. Rust Token Killer

RTK means Rust Token Killer.

Pi can rewrite Bash tool calls through the global RTK extension.

Do not add `rtk` to a command that does not call RTK directly.

A direct RTK command has `rtk` as its first token.

## 13. FFF Code Search

FFF is a code-search service.

Use `fffind` for file-name discovery in a Git-indexed repository.

Use `ffgrep` to search for identifiers in a Git-indexed repository.

Use a regular expression for alternative identifiers when one expression is clear.

Use separate `ffgrep` calls when separate searches are clearer.

Do not use shell `find` for code discovery in a Git-indexed repository.

Do not use shell `grep` for code discovery in a Git-indexed repository.

Use `rtk tree` for directory-tree inspection.

Use FFF for code discovery.

## 14. Session and Model Economy

Configured model settings are authoritative for every agent.

Do not override the model for a run unless the user explicitly authorizes that override.

Do not override thinking settings for a run unless the user explicitly authorizes that override.

Do not change agent configuration unless the user explicitly authorizes that change.

Do not change model configuration unless the user explicitly authorizes that change.

A parent session is the main orchestration session.

A child is a delegated subagent session.

For an implementation task, complete one shippable milestone in each parent session.

Use a fresh child for unrelated work.

Resume the same Reviewer for a focused follow-up.

Resume the same Oracle for a focused follow-up.

Do not launch a new Reviewer when a compatible retained Reviewer exists.

Do not launch a new Oracle when a compatible retained Oracle exists.

Run targeted checks in a child when the delegated task requires them.

Run full verification once at the parent gate.

Do not run full verification in every child.
